# RoadHouse BJJ



## Introduction
This is a project I have created for my first assignment in HTML and CSS. The project is for a Brazilian JiuJitsu club called Roadhhouse BJJ. The website is to allow interested parties, current and potential members to find  relevant information about the gym, where it's located and when the classes are along with more information regarding the gym itself. The webpage is fully responsive for devices from 300px to large monitors 1200px+.

You can access the page live via github pages on the url below.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
I used the website color-hex.com to find an appropriate colour scheme and decided on the shade and colour
#BEA477. Along with this I chose a secondary colour #CEBB9A for certain sections, along with inverting the text colour
#252525 for the header and footer. You can see a contrast grid of all colours used throughout the website, with a rating of AA or AAA for each colour palette used.

![contrast grid of colours](assets/documentation/contrast_grid_total.jpg)



### Typography
I chose to stick with a sans-serif font type for the entirety of the webpage as it is very clear and easy to read for all users. Body font was 'Roboto', while headings were 'Bebas Neue' of the sans-serif family.
### Imagery
The entirety of my gallery page was found from pexels.com along with the index hero image and the class photo page.owever many other images were used primarily from websites found on google. The coach images were from sherdog.com, a popular MMA site. The about hero image was from bjjfanactics.com and the gym photo from fittinsider.com.

I understand in a real website I would need to have image rights for images used or use free stock sites like pexels or others to ensure I am not breaking any copyright laws.

### Wireframes
I was unable to install balsamiq wireframing tool due to restrictions on the computer I am using, so I opted for a free tool online wireframe.cc . Although it was more difficult to use and didn't allow me plan as effectively as I would have liked, I made some rough wireframes for each page.

## Features

### Responsive Navigation Bar toggle
This code was taken from the LoveRunning course to enable this feature using only CSS and HTML and is visible under the nav bar styles on styles.css page.

### Working 404 page.
![404 page](assets/documentation/404_issue.jpg)


## Features to be Added
I would like to add a feature that would send out an automatic email once a form has been completed letting the end user know that we have received their form submission and will get in touch with them personally while also including an information pack in the email. This could be done by using an API from a company like Twilio, Bird or Mailersend.

A clickable image thread where users can click on an image to open it as a carousel, and scroll through the gallery images by clicking on a toggle, rather than all images being full size.


## Testing

### Lighthouse
Lighthouse results, it's worth noting that at time of testing my internet speed was not great, with a download speed of roughly 7mbps. Best practices score is due to cookies from the embedded google maps location at the bottom of the page.

![Lighthouse results for index page](assets/documentation/lighthouse_test.jpg)


Common issue seems to be with image size and type used for mobile versions of the website. In the future I will procure more modern images suited for web design rather than jpg or png.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing
Initially there was one error due to the label tag used for the nav toggle. More information on bug section.

### Manual Testing

Here I have tested all the features on each and every page of my website. Please see the results below.

Our goals were met in this testing as all pages are directly accessible and easy to find for the user, with clear descriptions where to find certain information along with an acknowledgement when a contact form is sent.

This was tested using a google pixel 6 pro, iphone 11 and responsive mode on a large PC monitor.

Format of the table below is as follows:

## Bug resolutions

When writing the html and CSS code for this website, some bugs were found and rectified along the way.

A major bug was the stretching of the Hero image on the index.html page. Due to the size of the image being used, on large screens this image would become stretched and off centre.

To fix this, I used a larger version of the same image (900x) and updated the CSS in a media query for screens of 900px and more to use this image, and update the positional values of the image. The CSS used to overcome this bug is shown below.


![Media query to fix hero image bug](assets/documentation/bug_1.jpg)

Another bug that was found was on the contact form. The contact form page would submit regardless of whether any class choices or contact information was added or not. This was due to the HTML code for the form not containing a required field. This was amended upon finding the issue when conducting manual testing.

When validating the page using wave, a bug was found due to the label tag being empty in the form that was used to create the navigation toggle as it was done purely using html and css. This was fixed due to help from the documentation below.

![CSS code used for this fix](assets/documentation/bug_2.jpg)

The final bug noticed when creating this website was that the schedule listed in the about page shows as pixelated when testing the responsiveness for smaller screens. This has been tested using 3 different mobile devices however and the image does not appear pixelated, and can be viewed/zoomed in as most images of this type would be on a mobile device.
